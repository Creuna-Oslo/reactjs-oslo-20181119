# Why Not `create-react-app` 🤷‍♀️

---

# `create-react-app` 👍🏻

- Exists
- Is cool
- Huge community
- Someone else maintains it

---

# `create-react-app` 👎🏻

- No support for Sass
    - We use this _a lot_
- No static site generation
    - We like to generate one of these and deploy as a mockup
- No server side rendering (on .NET)
    - Most of our backends are ASP.NET

---

# What To Do 🤷‍♀️

- ~~Put things on top of `create-react-app`~~ 💩
- Custom tooling 🛠

---

# How

- Minimum Viable Product ⛏ 
- Internal launch (beta) 🛳
- Gather feedback 🙋‍♀️
- Make it pretty 💅
- Beta ➡️ 1.0.0

---

# Demo 💻

```notes
yarn global add @creuna/cli
creuna new
creuna component
creuna page
creuna stateful
creuna stateless
```

---

# Building Blocks 🏗

- `@creuna/cli`
    - `@creuna/prompt`
    - `@creuna/create-react-app`
    - `@creuna/react-scripts`
    - `@creuna/react-components`

---

# [ORG STUFF]

`TODO`

- Transparency
- Collaboration
- Ownership
- Predictability
- Sharing
- Known tools (Git, GitHub issues, PRs, Markdown)

---

# [OPEN SOURCE ALL THE THINGS]

`TODO`

- All the org stuff, but externally as well
- We don't just want to make ourselves better
- Attract like-minded people
- Know (a bit more) what you're getting yourself into
