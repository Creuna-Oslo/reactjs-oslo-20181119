# Pelle Bjerkestrand 👨‍💻
## User Interface Developer ⌨️
## Team Lead 👨‍👧‍👦

`pelle.bjerkestrand@creuna.no` 💌

`@notpelle` 🐦

```notes
This is me. I lead the UI team here at Creuna. We are 11 at the moment, and looking for at least 4 more.

I've been programming professionally since 2010: full stack, but more frontend than backend the past couple of years.

Our team is quite new, having started in march 2018.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.

I will also be available after the talks.

# Agenda 👀

- Demo 💻
- Why and how we create and maintain our own tooling 🛠
- How we have started doing our organizational work 👩‍👧‍👦
- Why we open source these things 📖

```notes
The answer to these things is DX (developer experience).
```

---

# DX ➡️ Developer eXperience

```notes
Happy people -> happy code.
```

---

# Demo 💻

```notes
yarn global add @creuna/cli
creuna new
creuna component
creuna page
creuna stateful
creuna stateless
```

---

# Context 🖼

- Creuna, an agency 🏭
- UI Team, HTML/CSS/JS 💻
- React, a framework 🛠
- ASP.NET, a Microsoft thing ⛅️

```notes
We are a full service digital agency (with some non-digital things thrown in too, like product and package design).

Like I said: I lead the UI team in Creuna.

We use React for most things, even porting older projects from jQuery/Handlebars etc.

The Microsoft stack is huge here, and the only backend stack we really deliver on.
```

# `create-react-app` is sensible, right? 🤷‍♀️

```notes
Yes it is, given the right circumstances
```

---

# `create-react-app` 👍

✅ Exists

✅ Is cool

✅ Huge community

✅ Someone else maintains it

```notes
It might be more pragmatic to use something that exists

It's also a cool/good project with a large community

A plus that someone else maintains it, so we don't have to spend time on that
```

---

# `create-react-app` 👎

❌ No support for Sass

❌ No static site generation

❌ No server side rendering

```notes
We use Sass a lot

We like to generate static sites and deploy them as mockups, so that we are able to iterate quickly on the UI without building out every change further back/down in the stack

Most of our backends are ASP.NET MVC w/Razor, and it would be nice to render our UI there too
```

---

# What To Do 🤷‍♀️

- ~~Put things on top of `create-react-app`~~ 💩
- Custom tooling 🛠

```notes
This is our conclusion.

We feel that the cost of custom tooling is worth it.
```

---

# How

- Minimum Viable Product ⛏ 
- Beta (internal launch) 🛳
- Gather feedback 🙋‍♀️
- Make it pretty 💅
- Build more functionality 👷‍♀️
- Beta ➡️ 1.0.0

```notes
You can see the history on GitHub if you really want to follow the story.
```

---

# Minimum Viable Product ⛏ 

- Based on four real world, in production, customer projects
- Naïve scaffolding (just write files)
- No concept of ejecting / ejected from the start
- No extra tooling
- Figure out CI/CD (GitHub ➡️ Travis ➡️ npm) later

---

# Building Blocks 🏗

`@creuna/cli`

`@creuna/prompt`

`@creuna/create-react-app` ⬅️ MVP

`@creuna/react-scripts`

`@creuna/react-components`

```notes
cli: handling all the user input

prompt: handling all the interactivity after initial input

create-react-app: app scaffolding

react-scripts: scripts for working with react components

react-components: demo components that don't live on npm

Feel free to check these out. Everything is on GitHub.
```

# Organizational Work 🥅

- Transparency
- Collaboration
- Ownership
- Sharing

```notes
These are some of the things that I think are most important when it comes to organizational work.

Just being a manager that no one knows what does is a bit old school.

I work for my team, not the other way around.

This is not easy to accomplish, especially not when the existing way of working is not like this, but we're experimenting and iterating.
```

---

# Just Put It On GitHub 😱

- Git
- GitHub issues
- Pull requests (with discussions)
- Markdown
- Easy and possible to expose

```notes
GitHub will actually give us the tools we need to reach all our goals.

It's also a tool, or a collection of tools, that we already know how to use, or have to learn anyway.

Really easy to expose things to the rest of the world.
```

---

# OPEN SOURCE ALL THE THINGS

- Not just for us
- Attract like-minded people
- Know what you're getting yourself into

```notes
So why don't we just do that? EXPOSE ALL THE THINGS!

It's not just for us anymore, we want to inspire others as well.

We also, of course, want to attract people that want to work this way.

It's also nice to know be able to examine, in a little more detail than what is usual, what you are getting yourself into when working with us.
```
