# Pelle Bjerkestrand 👨‍💻

## User Interface Developer ⌨️

## Team Lead 👨‍👧‍👦

`pelle.bjerkestrand@creuna.no` 💌

`@notpelle` 🐦

```notes
This is me. I lead the UI team here at Creuna. We are 11 at the moment, and looking for at least 4 more.

I've been programming professionally since 2010: full stack, but more frontend than backend the past couple of years.

Our team is quite new, having started in march 2018.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.

I will also be available afterwards.
```

# Context 🖼

- Creuna, an agency 🏭
- UI Team, HTML/CSS/JS 💻
- React, a framework 🛠
- .NET, a Microsoft thing ⛅️

```notes
We are a customer experience agency, focusing on digital experiences (with some non-digital things thrown in too, like product and package design).

We are ~120 people in Oslo, with more (over 350 in total) in Stockholm (SE), Gothenburg (SE), Aarhus (DK) and Helsinki (FI).

Like I said: I lead the UI team in Creuna. At the moment we are 11 people.

We use React for most things, even porting older projects from jQuery/Handlebars/Knockout etc.

The Microsoft stack is huge here, and the only backend stack we really deliver on. In recent years this has gotten way more portable with the introduction of .NET Core.
```

# Agenda 👀

- CLI demo 💻
- Why and how we create and maintain our own tooling 🛠
- How we have started doing our organizational work 👩‍👧‍👦
- Why we open source these things 📖
- Real world projects 🌍

```notes
Today I'm going to show you our CLI tools and talk about how and why we created them.

I'm also going to touch a bit on how we do organizational work in the team that I lead and why we do it in that way.

At the end I'll show you some real world projects that are made by us using our tools.

Feel free to put your hand up or shout out if you have any questions or comments while I'm presenting, so we can keep things in context if it's relevant.

The short answer to the questions in that list is DX (developer experience).
```

---

# DX ➡️ Developer eXperience

```notes
This is very important for us, as:

Happy people ➡️ happy code ➡️ happy customers ➡️ happy business.
```

---

# CLI demo 💻

```notes
yarn global add @creuna/cli
creuna new
creuna component
creuna page
creuna stateful
creuna stateless
creuna lib
```

---

# Our Own Tooling 🛠

```notes
So this was a quick demo of our own tooling.

But why did we make this?

And how did we make it?

There are many options to choose from already, like Facebook's own create-react-app.

Let's take a look at our thought process in evaluating it.
```

---

# `create-react-app` is sensible, right? 🤷‍♀️

```notes
One would think that the framework makers' own tooling is good enough, right?

Yes it is, given the right circumstances.
```

---

# `create-react-app` 👍

✅ Exists

✅ Is cool

✅ Huge community

✅ Someone else maintains it

```notes
It might be more pragmatic to use something that exists than to build something new

It's also a cool/good project with a large community (since it's the "default")

A plus that someone else maintains it, so we don't have to spend time on that

We can, of course, contribute to it
```

---

# `create-react-app` 👎

❌ No support for Sass (_now_ there is)

❌ No static site generation

❌ No server side rendering

```notes
Pretend `create-react-app` 2 hasn't come out yet, because it has Sass support 😂

We use Sass a lot

We like to generate static sites and deploy them publicly, so that we are able to iterate quickly on the UI without building out every change further back/down in the stack

We even do projects for clients where the end result is a static site: fast + secure is a killer combo

Most of our backends are ASP.NET MVC w/Razor, and it would be nice to render our UI there too
```

---

# What To Do 🤷‍♀️

- Put things on top of `create-react-app` 🔌
- Custom tooling 🛠

```notes
We had two choices here.

We could either put things on top of `create-react-app`, which could have been nice had they had a nice way to write plugins.

Or we could write our own custom tooling and get everything exactly they way we want it, but it will take some extra time and effort.

Since `create-react-app` doesn't have all the things we need or want, we really didn't have any choice.

That's a good way to get something you really want as a developer, btw: just say that something must be done a certain way 😛
```

---

# What To Do 🤷‍♀️

- ~~Put things on top of `create-react-app`~~ 💩
- Custom tooling 🛠

```notes
This is our conclusion. Of course we wanted to create our own custom tooling.

Both because we actually need something different than what is available elsewhere, and because it's a fun challenge.

We also feel that the cost of custom tooling is worth it.
```

# How

- Minimum Viable Product ⛏
- Beta (internal launch) 🛳
- Gather feedback 🙋‍♀️
- Make it pretty 💅
- Build more functionality 👷‍♀️
- Beta ➡️ 1.0.0

```notes
So how did we do this?

We started with a really small MVP and built it out from there.

Then we launched an "internal" beta, which was open to anyone, but only presented internally (it was available on npm).

We gathered feedback from our own colleagues, and based on that feedback made the tool a little prettier and more user friendly.

We also built, and are still building, new functionality.

Finally we decided to release version 1 for real.

The current version is 1.2.1, with version 2 coming out as soon as we iron out some small bugs.

You can see the history on GitHub (github.com/Creuna-Oslo/create-react-app, github.com/Creuna-Oslo/cli) if you really want to follow the story.
```

---

# Minimum Viable Product ⛏

- Based on real world, in production, customer projects
- Naïve scaffolding (just write files)
- No concept of ejecting / ejected from the start
- No extra tooling
- Figure out CI/CD (GitHub ➡️ Travis ➡️ npm) later

```notes
Let's take a look at what we needed, at minimum, for this to even be a tool that would give us some value.

We must base it on how we work in real projects, since we are making it for use in our real projects.
```

---

# Building Blocks 🏗

`@creuna/cli`

`@creuna/prompt`

`@creuna/create-react-app` ⬅️ MVP

`@creuna/react-scripts`

`@creuna/react-components`

```notes
These are the building blocks as our tooling exists today. A bit more than the MVP, but they are all valuable additions.

cli: handling all the user input

prompt: handling all the interactivity after initial input

create-react-app: app scaffolding

react-scripts: scripts for working with react components

react-components: demo components that don't live on npm

Feel free to check these out. Everything is on GitHub (github.com/Creuna-Oslo).
```

---

# Built With Web Tech 🕸

- Git(Hub)
- Node
- Babel
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Ava

```notes
Everything is in Git, on GitHub, just like our client projects (which are not on GitHub).

We run everything on Node, even though we are a .NET shop, just like you can build sites and APIs that run on Node (we just use it for tooling instead).

Babel, of course, for transpilation.

ESLint and Prettier are a killer combo for enforcing and maintaining a coding style.

We use the wonderful Ava for testing.
```

---

# DX ➡️ Developer eXperience

```notes
Again, this is all about developer experience.

Working with our tooling feels just like working with the third party tools in our stack: git, npm, yarn etc.

Creating and maintaining our tooling feels just like creating and maintaining a client website, or at least helps us learn and grow as developers.
```

---

# The Stack 🥞

```notes
Let's take a look at the development stack.

- yarn or npm: whatever floats your boat.
- eslint, prettier, editorconfig, jsconfig for a happy editor, programmer and codebase.
- webpack and plugins within a well used and tested configuration
- react, of course (everything is react these days)
- scripts in `package.json` for all the things (go through them).
    - build
    - analyze
    - dev
    - build:static
    - test:ui
```

---

# Open Source 📖

```notes
All of this is open source, something we really love and care about, which leads us to our next main point.
```

---

# Open Source 📖

# Organizational Work 👩‍👧‍👦

```notes
Which is/are:

How we have started doing our organizational work 👩‍👧‍👦
Why we open source these things 📖

Being a programmer does not consist of mostly typing programs into the computer.

Don't become a programmer if you don't like people, certainly not a programmer at an agency.

Most of my day is spent figuring things out with other people (programmers, designers, strategists etc.), talking to clients and other stakeholders, and so on.

These so called "soft" skills are really hard, so we're trying to reach some goals in ways that may not be that traditional.
```

---

# Goals 🥅

- Transparency
- Collaboration
- Ownership
- Sharing

```notes
These are some of the things that I think are most important when it comes to organizational work, and also how we work day to day.

Me just being a manager that no one knows what does is a bit old school.

I want everything I do to be transparent to the rest of the team, and organization. I, as a manager, work for my team. Not the other way around.

I want the team, and anyone that wants to, to be able to contribute and collaborate.

I think this will lead to a sense of ownership and, if we're lucky, wanting to share how we do things with others.
```

---

# But How 🤷‍♀️

```notes
This is not easy to accomplish, nothing that's really worth it is, especially not when the existing way of working is not like this, but we're experimenting and iterating.
```

---

# Just Put It On GitHub 😱

- Git
- GitHub issues
- Pull requests (with discussions)
- Markdown
- Easy and possible to expose

```notes
This was one suggestion.

GitHub will actually give us the tools we need to reach all our goals.

It's also a tool, or a collection of tools, that we already know how to use, or have to learn anyway.

You can't really do any programming at scale without Git (or similar), and I don't think you should be doing any programming at all without it.

Markdown is here to stay: learn it. This whole presentation is Markdown.

Once something is on GitHub it's really easy to expose it to the rest of the world.
```

---

# And Open Source Everything 📖

- Not just for us
- Attract like-minded people
- Know what you're getting yourself into

```notes
So why don't we just do that? EXPOSE ALL THE THINGS!

It's not just for us anymore, we want to inspire others as well.

We also, of course, want to attract people that want to work this way.

And we want people to know, at least a little better, what they're getting themselves into.

Or at least be able to examine what the mindset of the people they will be working with is like.
```
