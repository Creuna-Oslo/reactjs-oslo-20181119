# Agenda 👀

- Why and how we create and maintain our own tooling 🛠
- Demo 💻
- How we have started doing our organizational work 👩‍👧‍👦
- Why we open source these things 📖

---

# Context 🖼

- Creuna, an agency 🏭
- UI code, HTML/CSS/JS 💻
- React, a framework 🛠
- ASP.NET, a Microsoft thing ☁️

---

# Sensible To Use `create-react-app`, Right 🤷‍♀️

---

# `create-react-app` 👍🏻

- Exists
- Is cool
- Huge community
- Someone else maintains it

---

# `create-react-app` 👎🏻

- No support for Sass (we use this _a lot_)
- No static site generation (we like to generate one of these and deploy as a mockup)
- No server side rendering (most of our backends are ASP.NET)

---

# What To Do 🤷‍♀️

- ~~Put things on top of `create-react-app`~~ 💩
- Custom tooling 🛠

---

# How

- Minimum Viable Product ⛏ 
- Internal launch (beta) 🛳
- Gather feedback 🙋‍♀️
- Make it pretty 💅
- Build more functionality 👷‍♀️
- Beta ➡️ 1.0.0

---

# Minimum Viable Product ⛏ 

- Based on four real world in production customer projects
- Naïve scaffolding (just write files)
- No concept of ejecting / ejected from the start
- No extra tooling
- Figure out CI/CD (GitHub ➡️ Travis ➡️ npm)

---

# Demo 💻

```notes
yarn global add @creuna/cli
creuna new
creuna component
creuna page
creuna stateful
creuna stateless
```

---

# Building Blocks 🏗

- `@creuna/cli`
    - `@creuna/prompt`
    - `@creuna/create-react-app`
    - `@creuna/react-scripts`
    - `@creuna/react-components`

---

# [ORG STUFF]

`TODO`

- Transparency
- Collaboration
- Ownership
- Predictability
- Sharing
- Known tools (Git, GitHub issues, PRs, Markdown)

---

# [OPEN SOURCE ALL THE THINGS]

`TODO`

- All the org stuff, but externally as well
- We don't just want to make ourselves better
- Attract like-minded people
- Know (a bit more) what you're getting yourself into
