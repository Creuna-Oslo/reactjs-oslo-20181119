# Pelle Bjerkestrand 👨‍💻
## User Interface Developer ⌨️
## Team Lead 👨‍👧‍👦

`pelle.bjerkestrand@creuna.no` 💌

`@notpelle` 🐦

```notes
This is me. I lead the UI team here at Creuna. We are 11 at the moment, and looking for at least 4 more.

I've been programming professionally since 2010: full stack, but more frontend than backend the past couple of years.

Our team is quite new, having started in march 2018.

Feel free to contact me with any questions or comments.

I will also be available afterwards.
```

# Context 🖼

- Creuna, an agency 🏭
- UI Team, HTML/CSS/JS 💻
- React, a framework 🛠
- .NET, a Microsoft thing ⛅️

```notes
We are a customer experience agency, focusing on digital experiences (with some non-digital things thrown in too, like product and package design).

We are ~120 people in Oslo, with more (over 350 in total) in Stockholm (SE), Gothenburg (SE), Aarhus (DK) and Helsinki (FI).

Like I said: I lead the UI team in Creuna. At the moment we are 11 people.

We use React for most things, even porting older projects from jQuery/Handlebars/Knockout etc.

The Microsoft stack is huge here, and the only backend stack we really deliver on. In recent years this has gotten way more portable with the introduction of .NET Core.

# Agenda 👀

- CLI demo 💻
- Why and how we create and maintain our own tooling 🛠
- How we have started doing our organizational work 👩‍👧‍👦
- Why we open source these things 📖
- Real world projects 🌍

```notes
The short answer to these questions is DX (developer experience).
```

---

# DX ➡️ Developer eXperience

```notes
Happy people ➡️ happy code ➡️ happy customers ➡️ happy business.
```

---

# CLI demo 💻

```notes
yarn global add @creuna/cli
creuna new
creuna component
creuna page
creuna stateful
creuna stateless
creuna lib
```

---

# Our Own Tooling 🛠

```notes
Why and how we create and maintain our own tooling
```

---

# `create-react-app` is sensible, right? 🤷‍♀️

```notes
Yes it is, given the right circumstances
```

---

# `create-react-app` 👍

✅ Exists

✅ Is cool

✅ Huge community

✅ Someone else maintains it

```notes
It might be more pragmatic to use something that exists

It's also a cool/good project with a large community

A plus that someone else maintains it, so we don't have to spend time on that
```

---

# `create-react-app` 👎

❌ No support for Sass

❌ No static site generation

❌ No server side rendering

```notes
Pretend `create-react-app` 2 hasn't come out yet, it has Sass support

We use Sass a lot

We like to generate static sites and deploy them as mockups, so that we are able to iterate quickly on the UI without building out every change further back/down in the stack

Most of our backends are ASP.NET MVC w/Razor, and it would be nice to render our UI there too
```

---

# What To Do 🤷‍♀️

- Put things on top of `create-react-app` 🔌
- Custom tooling 🛠

```notes
We have two choices here.

We can either put things on top of `create-react-app`, which could have been nice had they had a nice way to write plugins.

Or we can write our own custom tooling and get everything exactly they way we want it, but it will take some time.

Since `create-react-app` doesn't have all the things we need or want, we really didn't have any choice.
```

---

# What To Do 🤷‍♀️

- ~~Put things on top of `create-react-app`~~ 💩
- Custom tooling 🛠

```notes
This is our conclusion. Of course we wanted to create our own custom tooling.

Both because we actually need something different than what is available elsewhere, and because it's a fun challenge.

We also feel that the cost of custom tooling is worth it.
```

# How

- Minimum Viable Product ⛏ 
- Beta (internal launch) 🛳
- Gather feedback 🙋‍♀️
- Make it pretty 💅
- Build more functionality 👷‍♀️
- Beta ➡️ 1.0.0

```notes
So how did we do this?

We started with a really small MVP and built it out from there.

Then we launched an "internal" beta, which was open to anyone, but only presented internally (it was available on npm).

We gathered feedback from our own colleagues, and based on that feedback made the tool a little prettier and more user friendly.

We also built, and are still building, new functionality.

Finally we decided to release version 1 for real.

The current version is 1.2.1, with version 2 coming out as soon as we iron out some small bugs.

You can see the history on GitHub (https://github.com/Creuna-Oslo/create-react-app) if you really want to follow the story.
```

---

# Minimum Viable Product ⛏ 

- Based on four real world, in production, customer projects
- Naïve scaffolding (just write files)
- No concept of ejecting / ejected from the start
- No extra tooling
- Figure out CI/CD (GitHub ➡️ Travis ➡️ npm) later

---

# Building Blocks 🏗

`@creuna/cli`

`@creuna/prompt`

`@creuna/create-react-app` ⬅️ MVP

`@creuna/react-scripts`

`@creuna/react-components`

```notes
cli: handling all the user input

prompt: handling all the interactivity after initial input

create-react-app: app scaffolding

react-scripts: scripts for working with react components

react-components: demo components that don't live on npm

Feel free to check these out. Everything is on GitHub.
```

---

# Built With Web Tech 🕸

- Git(Hub)
- Node
- Babel
- ESLint
- Prettier
- Ava

```notes
Everything is in Git, on GitHub, just like our client projects (which are not on GitHub).

We run everything on Node, just like you can build sites and APIs that run on Node (we just use it for tooling instead).

Babel, of course, for transpilation.

ESLint and Prettier are a killer combo for enforcing and maintaining a coding style.

We use the wonderful Ava for testing.
```

---

# DX ➡️ Developer eXperience

```notes
Working with our tooling feels just like working with the third party tools in our stack: git, npm, yarn etc.

Creating and maintaining our tooling feels just like creating and maintaining a client website.
```

---

# The Stack 🥞

```notes
Let's take a look at the development stack.

- yarn or npm: whatever floats your boat.
- eslint, prettier, editorconfig, jsconfig for a happy editor, programmer and codebase.
- webpack and plugins with in a well used and tested configuration
- react
- scripts in `package.json` for all the things (go through them).
    - build
    - analyze
    - dev
    - build:static
    - test:ui
```

---

# Open Source 📖

```notes
All of this is open source, which leads us to our next main point.
```

# Open Source 📖
# Organizational Work 👩‍👧‍👦

```notes

Why we open source these things 📖
```

---

# Goals 🥅

- Transparency
- Collaboration
- Ownership
- Sharing

```notes
These are some of the things that I think are most important when it comes to organizational work.

Just being a manager that no one knows what does is a bit old school.

I want everything I do to be transparent to the rest of the team, and organization. I, as a manager, work for my team. Not the other way around.

I want the team, and anyone that wants to, to be able to contrubute and collaborate.

I think this will lead to a sense of ownership and, if we're lucky, wanting to share how we do things with others.
```

---

# But How 🤷‍♀️

```notes
This is not easy to accomplish, especially not when the existing way of working is not like this, but we're experimenting and iterating.
```

---

# Just Put It On GitHub 😱

- Git
- GitHub issues
- Pull requests (with discussions)
- Markdown
- Easy and possible to expose

```notes
This was one suggestions.

GitHub will actually give us the tools we need to reach all our goals.

It's also a tool, or a collection of tools, that we already know how to use, or have to learn anyway.

Really easy to expose things to the rest of the world.
```

---

# And Open Source Everything 📖

- Not just for us
- Attract like-minded people
- Know what you're getting yourself into

```notes
So why don't we just do that? EXPOSE ALL THE THINGS!

It's not just for us anymore, we want to inspire others as well.

We also, of course, want to attract people that want to work this way.

It's also nice to know be able to examine, in a little more detail than what is usual, what you are getting yourself into when working with us.

We need more people in our little developer family.
